# FIFADT

FIFADT is an terminal game made in python based on a game of the TV Box of Meo


## How It Works

In this game, your strategy choice is fundamental to success. For instance, if you opt for a 4-3-3 formation and face off against a 4-5-1 lineup, tactical decisions heavily influence the outcome. When possession is in midfield, both you and your opponent roll a random number. You roll within the range of 0 to 3, while your opponent rolls between 0 to 5. The higher number wins possession and advances the ball towards the strikers.

When presented with a shooting opportunity, you must select your target. Subsequently, the goalkeeper attempts to predict your choice and moves accordingly, enhancing the challenge and excitement of each scoring attempt.
